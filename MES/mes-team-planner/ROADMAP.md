  - Task cards with priority indicators, subtasks progress, and tags
  - Compact mobile responsive design
- [x] **Gantt Chart (ตารางงานรายวัน) Tab**:
  - Horizontal scroll timeline view
  - Expandable/Collapsible user rows
  - Responsive single-row toolbar for better mobile usability
- [x] **Calendar Tab**:
  - Month view calendar with event indicators
  - Detailed daily event listing panel
- [x] **Link Hub (คลังข้อมูล) Tab**:

  - Clean grid layout for easy access
- [x] **UI/UX Refinements**:

## 🛠️ Current Phase (Phase 2: Backend Integration & Database)
- [ ] Define MySQL database schemas (tasks, events, links, activities)
- [x] Fix the UI of `AddTaskModal` (remove Recurrence label, fix tooltip, adjust padding/card layout to be flatter and wider max-w-2xl).
- [x] Integrate full interactivity to `SpaceView` and `MyTasks`:
  - Added "New Task" and "New Project" creation buttons.
  - Allowed clicking on recent tasks to edit them.
  - Enabled status changes directly from the team view.
- [ ] Set up PHP RESTful API backend (`/server/api`)
- [ ] Connect React frontend components to PHP backend
- [ ] Implement data fetching, creation, updating, and deletion (CRUD)
- [ ] Implement robust error handling on the backend (e.g. handling missing task IDs gracefully).

## 🚀 Upcoming Features (Phase 3: Advanced Functionality)
- [ ] **Authentication & User Roles**: Login system to distinguish Admin vs normal users.
- [ ] **Real-time Notifications**: WebSockets or polling for live updates on task changes.
- [ ] **File Attachments**: Ability to upload images/documents to tasks.
- [ ] **Reporting & Export**: Export task boards to PDF or Excel.
- [ ] **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: Allow users to switch themes if necessary.
